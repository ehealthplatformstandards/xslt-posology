# xslt-posology
With this XSLT-posology you will be able to convert a complex structured posology in a medication scheme into a free text preceded by the word *converted*.
In the folder “demo” you will find 2 medication schemes as source to be converted by the XSLT. The result of this conversion is also present in the folder “demo”, both in FR and in NL.

(The XSLT can probably also be used to convert a complex structured posology in an electronic prescription (Regimen) to a string with free text preceded by the word *converted*, but this hasn’t been tested yet.)
 
This XSLT is offered free of charge by CGM (CompuGroup Medical) and VIDIS Project to all interested software vendors. It can be used on a voluntary/ facultative basis by prescription software in Belgium in order to comply with the homologation criteria of medication scheme, and more in particular to comply with rules of interoperability of structured posology in medication schemes (see folder “documentation” : 20210420_specificaties_posologie_v8.pdf).
